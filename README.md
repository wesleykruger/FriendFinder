# FriendFinder
This is a Node.js application designed to work with Express to provide a friend-matching experience. It uses server-side rendering to deliver web pages to the end user.

## Getting Started
This app is hosted on Heroku, so it can be accessed at: https://wkruger-friend-finder.herokuapp.com/survey. If you want to run it locally, you will need Node.js and the project's associated packages (Express).

## Running the project
Fairly simple survey application that will take user's personality responses and match them to a friend who is most similar to them based on their responses.

TODO: Add persistent data storage via JawsDB on Heroku.


### Project made using:
